# Introduction
My vimrc and colorscheme for Vim.

Most of the vimrc comes from Vim Bootstrap (<http://vim-bootstrap.com>), but it is modified to my tastes.

# Installation
Copy both files to your home directory and change them to hidden files:

    mv vimrc .vimrc

    mv vim .vim

When you open vim it will attempt to install all necessary plugins -- curl and git is required for this to work.
